                    <p>Survive is my inaugural venture into iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI. This text-based RPG immerses players into a zombie apocalypse, where every choice they make influences their journey. The game is designed to be both engaging and immersive, featuring comic-style images that complement the narrative.</p>
                    <p>In Survive, players awaken in a world overrun by zombies and must navigate through a series of decisions that determine the outcome of their adventure. From start to finish, creating this game has been an incredibly fun and educational experience, offering deep insights into SwiftUIâ€™s navigation and state management features. Each decision branches the story, pushing players to strategize their way through the apocalypse and ultimately survive.</p>

                        <h3>Dynamic Storytelling</h3>
                        <p>In its current form, the game features a single ending, but the foundation is laid for future expansion. Each decision shapes the narrative, and there is significant potential to develop multiple storylines and endings based on user choices. This initial version provides a glimpse into the dynamic storytelling possibilities that could be explored as the project evolves.</p>

                        <h3>Immersive Visuals</h3>
                        <p>Immerse yourself in the narrative through beautifully crafted comic-style images generated with AI. These visuals enhance the storytelling by bringing key scenes to life, adding depth and atmosphere to the text-based adventure. Each image complements the narrative, helping to visualize the world and characters of the zombie apocalypse, enriching the overall experience.</p>

                        <p>In Survive, every choice you make influences the narrative and story progression, though all paths currently lead to the same ending. This design ensures that each decision impacts the journey and provides a unique experience. There is significant potential to expand the game further, allowing for multiple endings and a richer narrative based on player choices.</p>

                        <p>The concept for Survive was inspired by a deep fascination with zombies and the goal of creating a simple, text-based app to gain hands-on experience with what I have been learning.
